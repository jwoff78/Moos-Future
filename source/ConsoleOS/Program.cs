/*
 * Notes & Ramblings:
 * I tried to pull Corlib out of the equation and just allow a project file, it appears it doesn't work that way
 * I think aleratively we can expand the scope of a reference to a shared item, not sure about this;
 * I might try to fiddle with a symbolic styled link, whether corlib becomes phyiscal or not I don't know;;
 * It's not my goal to give user less access to project files, the goal rather is to remove clutter potional,
 * I think I might split apart the .sln file or at least change it in such a way that all possible kernels are first thing
 * a user sees, I'd have to invest in in-depth documenation to ensure that even if edited the system would still compile
 * for everyone
